====================================================

This is a project for the practical Master Course "Mobile und verteilte Systeme" at LMU Munich in Winter term 20/21.  
We created a Multiplayer Online Card game for Android OS called Cabo.  
This repository contains 2 projects, which are neede for the game.  

- **CaboServer** is a Java-Project containing a SpringServer and everything else needed to deploy a Server enabling communication between the Clients.
- **CaboClient** contains the Android App.  


If you want to play the game and create an account, make sure, that you have added your SHA1 fingerprint to our Google Cloud API-Key.   
Otherwise you will not be able to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database.
However, it is also possible to play without an account, just press the skip button in the lower right corner.
