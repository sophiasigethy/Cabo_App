Cabo - A multiplayer online Card Game for Android OS
====================================================

This is a project developed within the practical Master Course "Mobile und verteilte Systeme" at LMU Munich in Winter term 20/21.  
We created a Multiplayer Online Card game for Android OS called Cabo.  
As this project was developed during the COVID 19 pandemic, our vision was to connect people in lonely times with a refreshing online-card game, while preserving the “feeling” of real life card games. 

In the following videos and explanations about the project are provided, but first brief technical notes:

   This repository contains 2 projects, which are needed for the game.  

   - **CaboServer** is a Java-Project containing a SpringServer and everything else needed to enable communication between the Clients.
   - **CaboClient** contains the Android App.  

  If you want to play the game and create an account, make sure, that you have added your SHA1 fingerprint to our Google Cloud API-Key.   
  Otherwise you will not be able to connect to the Firebase Realtime Database.
  However, it is also possible to play without an account, just press the skip button in the lower right corner.

Four videos showing the app's functionality and feartures are provided below. 
**Intro slides** are displayed after downloading the app to explain the rules and features. 
Next, **registering** to create an account is shown. 
Afterwards, the most interesting: an **exapmple round** showing how to play the game.
And finally, our special feature: **playing with an AI player**. 




These slides only appear when downloading the app the first time. However, rules can be looked up at any time within the app...
