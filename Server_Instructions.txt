To update CaboServer on the server, use the following steps:
- Make sure, your version of CaboServer can start locally without errors
- Enter Gradle Sidebar and run CaboServer->Tasks->build->bootJar
- If it was executed successfully, you can now find a working executable jar of the server locally under
CaboServer/build/libs/CaboServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Connect to the server using the credentials given to us by the tutors in our Discord Channel 
(Using Putty, WinScp, Filezilla, terminal,...)
- On the server, navigate to /home/gruppe3/CaboServer and remove CaboServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (sudo rm CaboServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- Copy the locally created jar to the server, into the exact location, you just deleted the other jar
- To start the new server use sudo service caboserver restart

In the future there will hopefully be a script, that just pulls the jar from our git repository and starts it automatically
